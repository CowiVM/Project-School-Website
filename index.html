"Live for other" by being the first school in the tricity to introduce a school bus using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG ) with an effort to reduce pollutants like carbon monoxide by 80% and hydrocarbons by 44% moreover it will not contaminate the ground water in case of leakage. The buses run on CNG emit less noise pollution it is equipped with all safest amenities. Despite the cost of purchase being high. We have set an example by showing out commitment towards the conversation of the environment

						<br>
						<br>
						We are all grateful to the Almighty for giving us this opportunity through life to serve and be a part of this serving in education. The persistent hard work of the Xavarian students, selfless commitment of the Teachers and the cooperation of the parents along with God‘s blessings have resulted in the achievement of very good academic results of Classes 10 and 12, which is a matter of great honour for St. Xavier’s Schools in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali.
						<br>
						<br>
						The recently introduced St. Xavier’s School App, to pay online
						School and Transport Fees is a home grown effort to help
						students and parents in paying their School and Transport Fee.
						The School App has been created for the convenience of
						parents. This will also facilitate in the future easy
						communication between the school and parents.
						<br>
						<br>
						In addition to co - curricular activities during school hours, St.
						Xavier’s School is encouraging sports and other activities in
						the evening too through professional coaching at no additional
						costs. You are requested to encourage your wards in availing
						this facility which will help in developing a healthy lifestyle.
						<br>
						<br>
						St. Xavier’s Chandigarh is the first School in the tricity to
						introduce a School bus using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
						instead of Diesel. This is in keeping with the belief of being
						responsible and making efforts in reducing the pollutants in the
						Atmosphere. It is well known that CNG is a clean gas with
						negligible particulate matter and non toxic emissions. Let us
						all in our own way preserve, protect and nurture our
						environment and be one with Nature.
